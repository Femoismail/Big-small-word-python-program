#This is big / small word checking program using python. The program allows you to create your own textfile and input a sentence in to the text file.

#The aim of this program is to check each word in the textfile and find out which word is the biggest in the textfile and which word is the smallest in the textfile.

#The program displays the output of the biggest word in the texfile as well as the length of the biggest word. The program also displays the output of the smallest word in the textfile as well as the length of the smallest word.



# In order to run the program copy code and paste in visual studio code, click run and follow the prompts to execute the program.

# each line of code is commented to explain what it does.
